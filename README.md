Code folder provides the code scripts for:

- Downscaling process [downscaling.py](downscaling.py)
- Upscaling Process [upscaling.py](upscaling.py)
- Multi-Objective Optimization with EA (MOEA) [influence_maximization.py](influence_maximization.py)

## Code's Parameters

For each file you want to run, just run the following command to access all the code's parameters:
```bash
python name_scipt.py --help
```

## Requirements

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

For the correct execution of downscaling.py the **graph-tool** library is needed. Please refer to the official [website](https://graph-tool.skewed.de) for the correct package installation.
